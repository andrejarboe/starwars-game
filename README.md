This repo is a simple RPG game with a Star Wars them. Users can select a character and choose to battle the remaining enemies in their own unique order. When a user makes a hit, their attack value grows. When a user is hit, their HP is decreased based on the enemy that attacked. The user wins when all enemies are destroyed. I was able to make this website after three weeks of training at the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp.
